Particulate matters, a major air pollutant, cause cardiopulmonary problems. It is vital to assess its spatiotemporal distributions and to discuss the chief influencing factors. Satellite based PM2.5 concentrations data is used to assess the spatial and temporal trends of PM2.5 distributions over the state of Meghalaya during the period of 2007-2016. Satellite derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) is related to PM2.5 concentrations and used for better spatial coverage. Spatial trends in distribution of PM2.5 concentrations is observed to increase from eastern to western part of Meghalaya. Minimum PM2.5 concentrations is detected in Jaintia hills and maximum in West Garo Hills. Temporally, PM2.5 levels showed a positive trend in all the districts of Meghalaya but is significant in only 2 districts namely Jaintia Hills and Ri Bhoi. Along with interior (inside Meghalaya) factors, exterior factors (outside Meghalaya) also may have influenced the accumulation of PM2.5 levels over the state.
