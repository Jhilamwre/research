excerpt: 'Assessing the sensitiveness of hydrological responses to changing climate is an important topic in the field of hydrology. Any substantial changes in the available water yield or runoff put the human society in danger. Thus, predicting the fluctuations in runoff generations is a key for proper implementation of water management plans. The present study is conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of water yield to variations in the annual precipitation by quantifying precipitation elasticity of runoff in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Budyko based climate elasticity method is adopted with a parametric Budyko equation to incorporate the inherent surface characteristics in the analysis. Pixel-scale calculations are carried out to implement the heterogeneity of hydro-climatological parameter into elasticity. The precipitation elasticity values are presented as spatial mean values. It is observed that elasticity value ranged between 1.254 and 1.505 with a mean value of 1.334 for the 39 watersheds, considered in the study. It means that a 10 % change in the mean annual precipitation would result in 12.54 % to 15.05 % change in runoff generation. The values of elasticity are further presented for 5 major river basins (ranged between 1.304 and 1.401) and the 51 districts (ranged between 1.254 and 1.445) covered by the state. A significant inverse exponential relationship is observed between gridded precipitation elasticity of runoff to runoff ratio (R 2 = 0.876, P < 0.01) and mean annual runoff (R 2 = 0.420, p < 0.01). In addition, it is observed that runoff is more sensitive to variation in annual precipitation in the arid regions of the state compared to the humid regions. Quantification of runoff elasticity to precipitation is an effective approach to evaluate the influence of climatic variability on the catchment hydrology.'
