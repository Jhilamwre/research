Global virtual water trade (VW) provides a holistic approach to assessing socio-economic aspects and water scarcity conditions of a region. However, the question of the sustainability of such trade is under-explored, given the redistribution of water resources because of climatic variability. The present study proposes a conceptual framework that highlights the virtual water trade volumes with water availability. An examination of traded water surpluses and deficits in 191 countries and 182 global watersheds is conducted. Furthermore, implications of trade practices against future water availability are assessed. About 45% of countries including major economies are recognised to be accomplishing VW trade unsustainably during 1996-2005. The majority of European and Asian countries are in a vulnerable state that indicates higher appropriation of water resources than availability influenced by precipitation and evaporation. Similarly, watersheds majorly within Western Europe among others, are found to be susceptible to vulnerability. Assessments against future climate indicated that vulnerable watersheds at the present climate tend to become more vulnerable in the future.
